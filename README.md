## Installation
1. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and install using recommended settings.

1. Do remember to check the type of __COM Port__ present in your machine, under __Device Manager > Ports__.

1. In Arduino IDE, under __Tools > Board__, select __NodeMCU x.x (ESP-12E Module)__.  [x.x denotes the version number, we are currently using __v1.0__]

1. Under __Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries__, search and install the following:
   - __DHT Sensor Library by Adafruit__ (use latest version, we're currently using __v1.3.4__), make sure DHT 11 is mentioned in the description.

1. [Adafruit_Sensor](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor.git) contains __*necessary*__ files to get your sketch up and running.
Visit the link, clone, extract and copy-paste (with replacement) in the library where your Arduino packages reside.
   - If you installed [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) in the default location,
   
     > (C:\Users\\{your_username}\Documents\Arduino)
     
     path should contain your library packages on a Windows machine.

## Installation
1. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and install using recommended settings.

   *Quick Tip:* Do remember to check the type of __COM Port__ present in your machine, under __Device Manager > Ports__ after connecting your board.

1. In Arduino IDE, under __File > Preferences__, go to the section which says __Additional Boards Manager URLs:__ and copy-paste the following comma-separated URLs :-
   ```
   https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json, http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
   ```
   These links are for __ESP-WROOM-32__ and __ESP8266__ boards.

1. [ __IMPORTANT__ ] Go to __Tools > Board > Boards Manager...__,
   - search for the package __esp8266 by ESP8266 Community__ and install the latest version. [We are currently using __v2.5.2__]
   - search for the package __esp32 by Espressif Systems__ and install the latest version. [We are currently using __v1.0.2__]

1. Under __Tools > Board__, 
   - select __NodeMCU x.x (ESP-12E Module)__, if you want to use NodeMCU ESP8266.  [x.x denotes the version number, we are currently using __v1.0__]
   - select __DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1__, if you want to use ESP-WROOM-32.

1. Under __Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries__, search and install the following:
   - __DHT Sensor Library by Adafruit__ (use latest version, we're currently using __v1.3.4__), make sure DHT 11 is mentioned in the description.
   - __ThingSpeak by MathWorks__ (use latest version, we're currently using __v1.5.0__), for using services of [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/).

1. [Adafruit_Sensor](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor.git) contains __*necessary*__ files to get your sketch up and running.
Visit the link, clone, extract and copy-paste (with replacement) in the library where your Arduino packages reside.
   - If you installed [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) in the default location,
   
     > (C:\Users\\{your_username}\Documents\Arduino)
     
     path should contain your library packages on a Windows machine.
